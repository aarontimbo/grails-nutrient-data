grails-nutrient-data
====================

Grails plugin with domain classes mapping USDA National Nutrient
Database for Standard Reference (sr23). The plugin contains domain
classes for all elements of the database as well as a service for
obtaining detailed nutrient information for a specific food given
an amount and number of servings. The plugin was designed for
release 23, but likely would work with future releases by the USDA.
